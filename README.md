C-ANN
=====

An Artificial Neuron Network

Instructions:
-------------

Compile ann.c with your favorite C compiler.

Next run the output file.

The program will wait for 5 inputs in the following format:

    (3 ints) ANN input, (double) increment, (double) mutation increment

If you do not want to mutate the ANN just pass 0 as the last argument.

It will then print the output of the ANN and repeat the process.
